# RevBayes 

Naive sequence stationary probability terms removed from log likelihood in PhyloCTMC (nucleotide).

Could easily be extended for PhyloCTMCBinary, etc.

At the moment, this only works if the input naive sequence has taxon name **naive**.

Could potentially be supplied as an argument, bit this makes modifications to `computeLnProbability` more complicated.
