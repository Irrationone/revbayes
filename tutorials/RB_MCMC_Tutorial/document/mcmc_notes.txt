Describe the analysis:
The group, sequence data, model.

This is an analysis of 13 species within the genus \emph{Fagus} (the beeches), based 
$2576$ sites sampled from one nuclear gene region (ITS) and two chloroplast gene regions
(rbcL and matK).
Here we assume a GTR+$\Gamma$ substitution model that is uniformly shared by all sites:
we refer to this as the `uniform' partition scheme, or PS0 for short.

What diagnostics are available from \verb!RevBayes!?

Let's look at the output in \verb!Tracer!:
  

MCMC diagnosis
1. Scale of the tuning parameter
what happens when you increase/decrease the scale of the proposal mechanism?

2. Pre-burnin
what happens when you do/not use pre-burnin?

3. Proposal weights
what happens when we change the proposal weights?
	increase one proposal relative to another
		or increase weight of a poorly mixing parameter
	increase the overall proposal weights uniformly
	force it to propose one move per cycle
	
4. Running under the prior
-suppress tree output
