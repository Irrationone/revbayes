        <p class="indent">The constant-rate birth-death process specifies a prior distribution on time trees, that is a uniform distribution on labelled histories and a distribtion on the divergence times.
            The trees are ultrametric (i.e. all tips were sampled at the same time). The speciation and extinction rates of the process are constant.
            We do not constraint the parameter values so that the speciation rate must be larger than the extinction rate.</p>

        <p class="indent">This function performs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on
	the parameters of a model. MCMC is a numerical method that, in this program, is used
	to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of a model. 
	The program takes as input a model and outputs a file containing the sampled values
	of the model&apos;s parameters. The fraction of the time any particular parameter value
	is visited by the Markov chain is a valid approximation of the parameter&apos;s posterior
	probability.</p>
        
        <h2>readCharacterData</h2><a href="readCharacterData.xml">View</a>
        <p class="indent">This function reads the character data contained in Phylip, Fasta, or
        Nexus files. The function takes as input the path and name of a file
        (if the contents of only a single file is to be read) or the path to a directory
        (if all of the Phylip, Fasta, or Nexus files in a directory are to be read).</p>
