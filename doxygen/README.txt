1) download revbayes sources. The file structure should be revbayes/trunk/... (if not you have to adapt the doxygen file)
2) create a directory for the doxygen output (e.g. revbayes_doxygen) at the same level as revbayes
3) go to that directory and copy the file revbayes/trunk/doxygen/Doxyfile there
4) run oxygen
$ doxygen Doxyfile
Note, you need to have doxygen and linked on machine.
