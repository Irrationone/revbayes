<h1>The Read Data Tool</h1>

<p>The Read Data Tool,</p>

<p><img width="256" height="256" src="../images/ReadDataTool" alt="ReadDataTool" /></p>

<p>reads in phylogenetic data. After having been read, the data is stored with the tool. RevBayes uses the Nexus Class Library (NCL), developed by Paul Lewis and Mark Holder, to read in data (Lewis, 2003). (The authors of RevBayes are grateful for this resource as writing code to parse files is not fun.)</p>

<p>The controller for the Read Data Tool allows one to select a file or directory:</p>

<p><img width="309" height="290" src="../images/ReadDataToolController" alt="ReadDataToolController" /></p>

<p>If you select a file, then RevBayes will attempt to read only this file. If, however, you select a directory, RevBayes will recursively read all of the files in that directory, and files in directories of that directory. If, for example, you selected your home directory, RevBayes would scan every file you have stored in your account attempting to read each. We added the ability to read all of the files in a directory to facilitate genomic analyses in which many hundreds or thousands of data files need to be read.</p>

<p>You can speficy the data format to be read, or have RevBayes attempt to discover the data type automatically.</p>

<p>RevBayes also allows a blank matrix to be created. You simply specify the size of the matrix. This blank matrix can then serve as a place holder for simulations in which data is simulated into a container.</p>

<p>Once data is read, one can inspect the data matrix (or matrices) using the matrix inspector:</p>

<p>You can get information on the details of each matrix by clicking on the &lsquo;Show Information&rsquo; button:</p>
